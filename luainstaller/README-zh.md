# `luainstaller`: Python Library for Packaging `.lua` into Binaries with Dependency Analysis

***[中文](./README-zh.md)***

> `luainstaller` is open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/Water-Run/luainstallers/tree/main/luainstaller), follows the `LGPL` license, and is a member of the [luainstallers](https://github.com/Water-Run/luainstallers/tree/main) toolkit

`luainstaller` is an open-source **Python library** that encapsulates the capability to **package `.lua` files into executables**.

`luainstaller` can be used:

- ***As a command-line tool***
- ***As a graphical tool***
- ***As a library imported into your projects***

## Installation

`luainstaller` is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install luainstaller
```

After installation, run in the terminal:

```bash
luainstaller
```

You should get the output:

```plaintext
luainstaller by WaterRun. Version 1.0.
Visit: https://github.com/Water-Run/luainstallers/tree/main/luainstaller :-)
```

Before using, you also need to configure the `luastatic` environment, including:

- lua: [Lua official website](https://www.lua.org/), including the package manager `luarocks`
- luastatic: `luarocks install luastatic`
- gcc: usually comes with `linux`, on `windows` refer to: [MinGW](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries)

And ensure these are configured in your environment variables.

## Getting Started Tutorial

The workflow of `luainstaller` is concise:

1. Scan the entry script recursively to build dependency analysis (if automatic dependency analysis is not disabled)
2. Merge manually configured dependency scripts to generate a dependency list
3. Call the packaging engine based on the dependency list to compile and output to the specified directory

As illustrated:

```plaintext
test.lua <entry script>
 | {automatic dependency analysis}
 ├──> require("utils/log")
 │     └── utils/log.lua
 │           └── require("utils/time")
 │                 └── utils/time.lua       ==>    <dependency manifest>
 ├──> require("core/init")                       [   
 │     ├── core/init.lua                         "utils/log.lua",
 │     ├── core/config.lua                       "utils/time.lua",
 │     └── core/db.lua                           "core/init.lua",
 └──(manually configured dependencies)            "core/config.lua",
       └── extra/plugin.lua                      "core/db.lua", 
                                                 "extra/plugin.lua"
                                                 ]                                     
                                          ↓
                       {call precompiled luastatic compilation command for corresponding version}
win64_546 test.lua utils/log.lua utils/time.lua core/init.lua core/config.lua core/db.lua extra/plugin.lua -o test.exe
```

### About Automatic Dependency Analysis

The automatic dependency analysis engine of `luainstaller` will match `require` statements in the following forms:

```lua
require '{pkg_name}'
require "{pkg_name}"
require('pkg_name')
require("pkg_name")
require([[pkg_name]])
```

Other forms will cause errors, including dynamic dependencies.

> In such cases, you should disable automatic dependency analysis and manually add the required dependencies

### Using as a Graphical Tool

The simplest way to use it is through the `GUI`.
`luainstaller` provides a graphical interface implemented with `Tkinter`. After installation, enter in the terminal:

```bash
luainstaller-gui
```

This will launch it.

> The GUI interface only includes basic features

### Using as a Command-Line Tool

`luainstaller` can also be used directly as a command-line tool. Simply enter in the terminal:

```bash
luainstaller
```

> Or `luainstaller-cli`, both are equivalent

#### Command Set

##### Get Help

```bash
luainstaller help
```

This will output usage help.

##### Get Logs

```bash
luainstaller logs [-limit <limit number>] [-asc]
```

This will output the operation logs stored by luainstaller.

*Parameters:*

- limit: The number of outputs to limit, a positive integer
- asc: In chronological order (default is reverse order)

> The logging system uses SimpSave

##### Dependency Analysis

```bash
luainstaller analyze <entry script> [-max <max dependencies>] [--detail]
```

This will perform dependency analysis and output the analysis list.

*Parameters:*

- max: Maximum dependency tree limit, a positive integer
- detail: Detailed runtime output

> By default, analyzes up to 36 dependencies.

##### Execute Compilation

```bash
luainstaller build <entry script> [-require <dependent .lua scripts>] [-max <max dependencies>] [-output <output binary path>] [--manual] [--detail]
```

*Parameters:*

- entry script: The corresponding entry script, starting point of dependency analysis
- require: Dependent scripts, if the corresponding script has been automatically analyzed by the analysis engine, it will be skipped. Multiple scripts separated by commas
- max: Maximum dependency tree limit, a positive integer. By default, analyzes up to 36
- output: Specifies the output binary path, defaults to an executable file with the same name as the .lua in the current directory, automatically adding .exe suffix on Windows platform
- manual: Do not perform dependency analysis, directly compile the entry script unless forcibly specified using -require
- detail: Detailed runtime output

*Examples:*

```bash
luainstaller hello_world.lua
```

Compiles hello_world.lua into an executable hello_world (Linux) or hello_world.exe (Windows) in the same directory.

```bash
luainstaller a.lua -require b.lua,c.lua --manual
```

Packages a.lua together with dependencies b.lua and c.lua into a binary without automatic dependency analysis. The behavior is completely consistent with using luastatic directly.

```bash
luainstaller test.lua -max 100 -output ../myProgram --detail
```

Analyzes test.lua with up to 100 dependency items, packages it into the myProgram binary in the parent directory, and displays detailed compilation information.

## Using as a Library

`luainstaller` can also be imported as a library into your scripts:

```python
import luainstaller
```

And provides a functional API.

## API Reference

### `get_logs()`

Get logs

```python
def get_logs(limit: int | None = None,
             _range: range | None = None,
             desc: bool = True) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    r"""
    Returns luainstaller logs.
    :param limit: Return number limit, None means no limit
    :param _range: Return range limit, None means no limit
    :param desc: Whether to return in reverse order
    :return list[dict[str, Any]]: List of log dictionaries
    """
```

Example:

```python
import luainstaller

log_1: dict = luainstaller.get_logs() # Get all logs in reverse order
log_2: dict = luainstaller.get_logs(limit=100, _range=range(128, 256), desc=False) # Get up to 100 logs in order, within the range of 128 to 256
```

### `analyze()`

Execute dependency analysis (corresponds to CLI's `luainstaller analyze`)

```python
def analyze(entry: str,
            max_deps: int = 36) -> list[str]:
    r"""
    Execute dependency analysis on the entry script.

    :param entry: Entry script path
    :param max_deps: Maximum recursive dependency count, default 36
    :return list[str]: List of dependency script paths obtained from analysis
    """
```

Example:

```python
import luainstaller

deps_1: list = luainstaller.analyze("main.lua") # Dependency analysis, analyzes up to 36 dependencies by default
deps_2: list = luainstaller.analyze("main.lua", max_deps=112) # Execute dependency analysis, modify maximum dependency analysis count to 112
```

### `build()`

Execute compilation (corresponds to CLI's `luainstaller build`)

```python
def build(entry: str,
          requires: list[str] | None = None,
          max_deps: int = 36,
          output: str | None = None,
          use_luastatic: bool = False,
          manual: bool = False,
          detail: bool = False,
          binary: str | None = None) -> str:
    r"""
    Execute script compilation.

    :param entry: Entry script
    :param requires: Manually specify dependency list; if empty, rely only on automatic analysis
    :param max_deps: Maximum dependency tree analysis count
    :param output: Output binary path, None uses default rule
    :param use_luastatic: Whether to use luastatic as packaging engine
    :param manual: Disable automatic dependency analysis
    :param detail: Whether to output detailed information
    :param binary: Specify precompiled luastatic binary (e.g., 'win64_546')
    :return str: Path of the generated executable file
    """
```

Example:

```python
import luainstaller

# Simplest build method, automatically analyzes dependencies and generates an executable with the same name as the script
luainstaller.build("hello.lua")

# Manual mode: Disable automatic dependency analysis, compile only with scripts specified in requires
luainstaller.build("a.lua", requires=["b.lua", "c.lua"], manual=True)

# Advanced build example:
# - Enable luastatic engine
# - Specify using precompiled binary lin32_515 (linux 32bit + lua 5.1.5)
# - Set maximum dependency analysis count to 100
# - Output binary to "bin/myProgram"
# - Enable detailed output
luainstaller.build(
    "test.lua",
    max_deps=100,
    output="bin/myProgram",
    use_luastatic=True,
    detail=True,
    binary="lin32_515"
)
```
